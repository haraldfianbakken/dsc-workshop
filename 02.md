# Remoting
If you're using Push configuration or need to remotely do work on a server you should know about PSRemoting and a few of the things you can do.

For the simplicity, we will use the same machine to establish a "remote session". 

## Enter a session remotely:

```powershell

$cred = Get-credential;
$sess = new-pssessipon -computername localhost -credential $cred;
Enter-PSSession $sess;

``` 
From here you can play around as you normally would in your shell (Note that there is a few limitations, as this operates over wmi and is serializable back to your computer).
Exit the session by typing exit;

## Copy items
To copy items to a remote session you can use Copy-Item -ToSession 

```powershell
Copy-Item c:\temp\file1.txt -ToSession $sess -Destination c:\temp2\File1.txt
```

## Invoke commands on remote machine

To invoke a command on a remote machine and get the result back you can use Invoke-command -Session 

```powershell
$result = Invoke-Command -Session $sess -Scriptblock {Get-process}
$result
```

Now you should have an idea on how easily you could copy modules or install modules on the remote machine by automation.


## Pushing DSC configuration to remote machine

Uses remoting and WinRM. You can author configurations, compile them and push them to a remote server. 
If you're on your host machine and have enabled WinRM and added the host to your trusted clients you can use Start-DscCOnfiguration -ComputerName <remotename> -credential $cred 

```powershell

# Add some example here (From your host machine, not your Hyper-V)


```
