# Composite resources

Composite resources can be a nice way of merging "common" code that can be shared accross configurations and to make re-usable components. 
A composite resource is nothing more than a DSCResource with a schema within a rootModule. It can have it's own dependencies and imports.


## Create your first composite resource 

We will create a simple composite resource that takes filenames 

```powershell

<# Implement in workshop #>

$env:psmodulepath
  |- MyUtils
    |- MyUtils.psd1
    |- DSCResources
      |- CreateFolders
       |- CreateFolders.psd1
       |- CreateFOlders.schema.psm1

```

## Use the module in your DSC document

```powershell

<# Implement in workshop #>

```
