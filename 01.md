# Basic DSC

To quickly re-cap what you've might forgotten about DSC. We will create a simple configuration to enable you to get started

## First configuration

```powershell
Configuration InitialConfiguration {
    Import-DscResource “ModuleName 'PSDesiredStateConfiguration'
    
    Node localhost {
        File TmpFolderMustExists {
            Type = 'Directory'
            Ensure = 'Present'
            Destination = 'C:\tmp'
        }
    }
}

InitialConfiguration
```

Run this configuration by running Start-DSCConfiguration. 

We'll go ahead and add some more features to the configuration


```powershell

<# Todo in workshop - WindowsFeature, Log #>
```
## Parameters
A simple configuration as the one above can only get you so far. By adding params to the configuration, we get a whole lot more flexibility. 


```powershell
<# Todo in workshop #>
```

## Lets take a look at the mofs


## Configuration files

How does the configuration file really work? What's going on here? Let's take a look.

Create the following ConfigurationFile and name it NodeData.psd1

```powershell

<# Todo in workshop #>
```

Now import it into a variable by using Import-PowerShelldatafile and explore it's contents. 

We'll now create a extended configuration for the sake of this example using node configuration


```powershell

<# Todo in workshop #>
```


## How about credentials
